= Add Enum
:sectanchors:

Go ahead and enhance your Spring Boot application by adding a new enum:

[source,kotlin]
----
enum class TreatmentType(
    val displayName: String,
    val duration: Duration,
) {
    CHECK_UP("Check-up", Duration.ofMinutes(30)),
    CLEANING("Cleaning", Duration.ofMinutes(60)),
    TOOTH_EXTRACTION("Tooth Extraction", Duration.ofMinutes(90)),
    FILLING("Filling", Duration.ofMinutes(120)),
    ROOT_CANAL("Root Canal", Duration.ofMinutes(120));
}
----

Then incorporate this enum into the `Treatment` class as follows:

[source,kotlin]
----
class Treatment(
    val id: String, val name: String,
    val type: TreatmentType,
) {
    val duration = type.duration
    // the rest of the class
}
----

This modification enhances the clarity and robustness of your data model by categorizing treatments and explicitly defining their durations. Note that in the updated `Treatment` class, we have removed `duration` from the constructor parameters and instead derive it from the `type` property. This change illustrates how we can associate specific data (in this case, duration) with each constant in an enum class.
