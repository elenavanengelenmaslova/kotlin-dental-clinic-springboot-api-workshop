= Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin and Spring Boot

In this workshop you will learn how to represent real-world entities and relationships through code. Kotlin not only embraces the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming but also enhances them with its concise syntax and unique features. As you progress through the workshop, you will work on the "DentalClinic" application, utilizing classes, data classes, and enum classes. While constructing the application, you will get familiar with the object keyword, apply inheritance, and integrate interfaces and polymorphism. Concepts such as generics, sealed and value classes will be vital in building a robust application. Furthermore, smart casts, restructuring declarations, and annotations will be the tools for refining your code.
This hands-on approach ensures your understanding extends beyond theory, giving you practical experience with Kotlin’s object-oriented capabilities.
