= Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin and Spring Boot

== Workshop Overview

Dive into Kotlin's object-oriented capabilities through a hands-on approach with the Spring Boot "DentalClinic" application.

*Key Takeaways:*

- Grasp how to depict *real-world entities* and relationships in code.
- Harness Kotlin’s blend of both *classic* and *innovative features*.
- Construct using different class types: _standard_, _data_, and _enum_.
- Understand the `object` keyword and the principles of _inheritance_.
- Delve deep into *interfaces*, *polymorphism*, and other advanced aspects.
- Leverage _generics_, _sealed/value classes_ for a robust application design.
- Refine code through _smart casts_, _restructuring_, and _annotations_.

At the end of this workshop, you'll have practical experience, moving beyond just theory, to  understand Kotlin's  object-oriented framework.
